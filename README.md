## A note about the Lecture 5

The lecture 5 is stolen from the wonderful [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) by [Danielle Navarro](https://twitter.com/djnavarro). The lecture reproduces parts of code from the book to demonstrate how to implement some statistical techniques in R for an audience who already has technical understanding of the topic.
